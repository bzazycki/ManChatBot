        <h1>Welcome to MannyConnect</h1>
        <p>Your centralized hub for managing the ChatGPT-based assistant platform. This tool supports organizations in empowering communities and improving outreach efforts for vulnerable populations. The platform is designed to help assist individuals experiencing homelessness, providing them access to essential resources, such as shelters, food banks, and medical care, all through an easy-to-use chatbot interface.</p>
        <p>
          As part of our study abroad project at Miami University, we are a dedicated group of students working in collaboration with local organizations in Manchester. Our mission is to design and implement a chatbot that can help individuals who are homeless access crucial support services. This tool is just one part of our broader effort to improve the well-being of underserved populations by harnessing the power of technology.
        </p>

        <!-- About Section -->
        <h2>About MannyConnect</h2>
        <p>
          MannyConnect is an admin portal designed for organizations to configure and manage their AI-powered chatbot solutions. This platform is specifically tailored for assisting underserved populations, such as homeless individuals. The chatbot serves as a bridge between these individuals and the resources they need to regain stability and find support.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our project team consists of a group of students from Miami University, here in Manchester as part of our study abroad program. We are working closely with local social service organizations to understand the challenges faced by the homeless population and to design solutions that address these issues effectively. The platform we are building will streamline chatbot management, providing tools to help users control themes, notifications, and system configurations.
        </p>
        <p>
          By enhancing communication between social service providers and those in need, we aim to empower vulnerable populations to access essential services more efficiently. We believe that our solution has the potential to make a meaningful impact on the homeless community, and we are excited to be part of this transformative project.
