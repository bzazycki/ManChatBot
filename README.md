# ManChatBot
Group 3 for Manchester study abroad project.

We are making a 'chatbot' app that will run on an android tablet on 'kiosk mode' and assist homeless people who walk up to the tablet. 

We will have a backend that makes API calls to OpenAI and a frontend android app that runs the GUI, text recognition, and text-to-speech.
